Based on the data given the following conclusions have been made.

1) There is a signifcant male to female ratio where 78% are men vs. only 22% women. Also, among all the players, most of the people who play randing from 20-24. This is significant enough to create a marketing strategy to reach out to men between the ages of 20-24.

2) Of the 573 unique players who made item purchases in the game, 'Betrayal, Whisper of Greiving Widows' was the most popular item in the game. This must mean that its stats or purpose has high value in the game.

3) Although 'Betrayal, Whisper of Greiving Widows' was the most purchased, in a business aspect, I would be most pleased by the 'Retribution Axe' which was most purchased. An item like this will contribute to the funding and further development of the game.
